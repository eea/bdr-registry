    <p>Reporting data on F-Gases covering {{ reporting_year }}</p>
    <p>Dear {{ person.formal_name }},</p>
    <p>This message is addressed to you as the contact person of an undertaking that needs to report data on fluorinated
      greenhouse gases (F-Gases) under Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006.</p>
    <p>The report needs to be submitted to the European Environment Agency (EEA) using the online Business Data Repository
      (BDR) at&nbsp;<a href="https://bdr.eionet.europa.eu/">bdr.eionet.europa.eu</a>.</p>
    <p>{% if use_reset_url %}</p>
    <p>In order to submit your report you will need to login using the username and password for your company. The company
      for which you have received reporting rights
      is&nbsp;<strong>{{ company.name }}</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>{{ company.country.name }}</strong>.You have
      received a personal account for reporting under this company. The
      username&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>{{ account.uid}}</strong>&nbsp;and you can set your password using the
      following&nbsp;<a href="{{ url }}">link</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>.</p>
    <p>{% else %}</p>
    <p>In order to submit your report you will need to login using the username and password for your company. The company
      for which you have received reporting rights
      is&nbsp;<strong>{{ company.name }}</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>{{ company.country.name }}</strong>. The username
      for your company is:&nbsp;<strong>{{ account.uid }}</strong>&nbsp;and the password
      is&nbsp;<strong>{{ account.password }}</strong>.</p>
    <p>{% endif %}</p>
    <p>Please note that this password will be valid for reporting during the year {{ reporting_year }}. To assure
      confidentiality we will reset the password at the beginning of {{ next_year }}.</p>
    <h1>How to submit your report?</h1>
    <p>Detailed information on how to upload your delivery to BDR is available at:&nbsp;<a
        href="https://bdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/upload.html">bdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/upload.html</a>.</p>
    <h1>Reporting requirements and forms</h1>
    <p>From this year the EEA is using online webforms to collect the data you need to submit. This allows amongst others
      the data to be fed directly into a database without the need for manual processing. The webforms can perform certain
      checks immediately while you are completing the form or immediately after submission. This will increase the user
      friendliness and reduce the administrative burden for all stakeholders. It will also reduce the number of questions
      posed to you after submission. While the webforms by nature will look somewhat different from the Excel sheets used
      so far, no additional data will be requested compared to previous years. Due to the functionality of the online
      forms it was possible to eliminate certain tables and to avoid that data needs to be repeated in two different
      forms.</p>
    <p>Reporting is not required if you produce, import or export less than one tonne of fluorinated greenhouse gases.</p>
