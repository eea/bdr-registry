Reporting data on ODS covering {{ reporting_year }}
Dear {{ person.formal_name }},

This message is addressed to you as the contact person of an undertaking that needs to report data on Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) under Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009.

The report needs to be submitted to the European Environment Agency (EEA) using the online Business Data Repository (BDR) at bdr.eionet.europa.eu.

In order to submit your report you will need to login using the username and password for your company. The company for which you have received reporting rights is {{ company.name }} in {{ company.country.name }}. The username for your company is {{ account.uid }} and the password is {{ account.password }}.

Please note that this password will be valid for reporting during the year {{ reporting_year }}. To assure confidentiality we will reset the password at the beginning of {{ next_year }}.

How to submit your report?
Detailed information on how to upload your delivery to BDR is available at: https://bdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/ods.

Reporting requirements and forms
The EEA is using online webforms to collect the data you need to submit. This allows amongst others the data to be fed directly into a database without the need for manual processing. The webforms can perform certain checks immediately while you are completing the form or immediately after submission. This will increase the user friendliness and reduce the administrative burden for all stakeholders. It will also reduce the number of questions posed to you after submission.

For assistance during reporting, please consider the two different guidance documents that can be accessed under the following link: https://bdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/ods
