  <p><u>Reporting requirements and forms</u></p>

  <p>
    From this year the EEA is collecting the corrections from cars
    manufacturers using the BDR. When notifying corrections back to the
    Commission, the manufacturer must include all records and all entries
    that are relevant for it; i.e. both those that the manufacturer
    considers correct as well as those that have been corrected

    For 2014, manufacturers can provide data in several formats: .xls, .csv,
    .xml, .mdb.
