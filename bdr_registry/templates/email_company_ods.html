  <p>Dear {{ person.formal_name }},</p>

  <p>
    This message is addressed to you as the contact person of an
    undertaking that needs to report data on Ozone Depleting Substances
    (ODS) under Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009.
  </p>

  <p>
    The report needs to be submitted to the European Environment Agency
    (EEA) using the online Business Data Repository (BDR) at <a
    href="https://bdr.eionet.europa.eu/">bdr.eionet.europa.eu</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to submit your report you will need to login using the
    username and password for your company. The company for which you
    have received reporting rights is <b>{{ company.name }}</b> in
    <b>{{ company.country.name }}</b>. The username for your
    company is: <b>{{ company.account.uid }}</b> and the password
    is <b>{{ company.account.password }}</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that this password will be valid for reporting during the
    year {{ reporting_year }}.  To assure confidentiality we will reset the password at
    the beginning of {{ next_year }}.
  </p>

  <p><u>How to submit your report?</u></p>

  <p>
    Detailed information on how to upload your delivery to BDR is
    available at: <a
    href="https://bdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/upload.html"
    >bdr.eionet.europa.eu/help/upload.html</a>.
  </p>

  <p><u>Reporting requirements and forms</u></p>

  <p>
    From this year the EEA is using online webforms to collect the data
    you need to submit. This allows amongst others the data to be fed
    directly into a database without the need for manual processing. The
    webforms can perform certain checks immediately while you are
    completing the form or immediately after submission. This will
    increase the user friendliness and reduce the administrative burden
    for all stakeholders. It will also reduce the number of questions
    posed to you after submission. While the webforms by nature will
    look somewhat different from the Excel sheets used so far, no
    additional data will be requested compared to previous years. Due to
    the functionality of the online forms it was possible to eliminate
    certain tables and to avoid that data needs to be repeated in two
    different forms. For example companies importing ODS and using them
    for feedstock data had to fill in certain data in both forms in the
    past which was an additional source of errors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reporting is not required if you solely import or export products or
    equipments containing or relying on ODS (e.g. fire extinguishers or
    aircraft). Reporting is not required if you produce, import or
    export less than one tonne of fluorinated greenhouse gases.
